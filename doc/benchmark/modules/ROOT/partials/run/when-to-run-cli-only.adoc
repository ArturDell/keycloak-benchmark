Use this to run a Keycloak benchmark against a locally running Keycloak instance.
When running more than 300 new users per second against a remote instance of Keycloak, the load generation might stall due to a lot of network connections in `TIME_WAIT` mode.
In those cases, use the xref:run/running-benchmark-ansible.adoc[] or a similar mechanism to split the load generation across multiple nodes.
